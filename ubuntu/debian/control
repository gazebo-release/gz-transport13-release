Description: Gazebo transport Library - Core Dev files
 Gazebo transport library combines ZeroMQ with Protobufs to create a fast and
 efficient message passing system. Asynchronous message publication and
 subscription is provided along with service calls and discovery.
 .
 Gazebo is a set of simple libraries that provide useful
 functionality to bootstrap robot applications. The included libraries
 encapsulate all the essentials, such as common math data types, console
 logging, 3D mesh management, and asynchronous message passing.
 .
 The package ships the Gazebo transport core development files
